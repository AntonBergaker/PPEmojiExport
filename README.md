# PPEmojiExport
Emoji export for Pentapop/Gamemaker.
Exports the twemoji emoji as texture pages and makes a .gml file meant to be loaded as a json string in GameMaker.

Made pretty much only for personal use for [Pentapop](https://anton.bergaker.com/pentapop). Don't expect binaries or customizability outside changing values in the script!
